**How to re-flash firmware**

1. Put a corresponding binary into a TF card (micro SD). The 128MB TF comes with SKR v1.3 which must be **FAT16** formatted, other larger TF can be FAT32.
2. Rename the file as **firmware.bin**
3. Put the TF card into the slot on SKR v1.3
4. Reboot and it will re-flash. If success, the firmware.bin should have been renamed as FIRMWARE.CUR.
