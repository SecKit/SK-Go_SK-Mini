Slicing tips

Printed files are all non-structural components so a common PLA or PETG filament with 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layer height will do. Use ABS/ASA if your printer is enclosed. For special slicing settings please refer to the README.md file and print orientation pictures in each STL directory.
