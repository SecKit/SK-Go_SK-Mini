BMG adaptor is the plate between NEMA17 pancake stepper and BMG extruder, providing a mounting base to the CoreXY motion.

In case that some extruders have heat sink integrated so the overall length are shorter, you might have to lower the mounting holes for the stepper so the nozzle can still touch the build surface at Z=0.
