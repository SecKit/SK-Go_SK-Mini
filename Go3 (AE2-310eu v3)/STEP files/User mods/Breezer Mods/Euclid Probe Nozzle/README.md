# Breezer Nozzle Mod for Euclid Probe

This mod adapts the Breezer Nozzle to allow the use of the Euclid probe, ensuring the probe is centered on the nozzle. It includes both a one-piece and a two-piece probe dock. The two-piece dock may require some modification to accommodate height changes.

## Parts Required

Breezer Nozzle
Euclid Probe
One-piece probe dock or two-piece probe dock
2x M3 heat inserts
1x T-nut
3x M3 Cap Screws

# Assembly Instructions

## Prepare for installation:

Insert the 2 M3 heat inserts into the Upper Mount of the two-piece dock if you are using this version. Ensure they are properly seated.
Attach the Euclid probe to the Breezer Nozzle.

## Attach the Dock:

Mount the dock to the printer frame ensuring it aligns correctly for easy docking and undocking of the Euclid probe.
Depending on your printer setup, you may need to make some adjustments to the height of the probe dock if using the 2 piece version and thew nozzle may need to be moved. Ensure the probe can dock and undock smoothly without interference. Test the docking mechanism and adjust as necessary to achieve a perfect fit.
If height adjustment is needed, useing the two-piece dock. You can modify the STEP file, use shims, or heat and bend as needed.

## Calibration:

Once installed, perform a z height calibration sequence to ensure the probe is functioning correctly and providing accurate measurements.
A euclid.cfg file is provided for reference. Ensure all docking positions, etc., are compatible with your machine and positioning of the dock.
