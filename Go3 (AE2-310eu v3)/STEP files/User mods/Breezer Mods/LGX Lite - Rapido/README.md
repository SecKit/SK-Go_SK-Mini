# LGX Light and Rapido Direct Mount

This mod allows for the direct attachment of the LGX Light and the Rapido hotend to the Seckit Breezer duct. It incorporates a 4010 fan into the design for efficient cooling. The installation process involves removing the V6 mount from the Rapido and directly mounting it to the provided bracket.

# Parts Required

LGX Light
Rapido hotend
4010 fan
4x M3 heat inserts (for the fan)
4x M3 bolts (appropriate length for your setup to mount the fan)
2x M3 x 40mm or 45mm screws (for mounting to the Breezer duct)
Small piece of Bowden tube

## Assembly Instructions

# Prepare the Fan:

Insert Heat Inserts:
Insert the 4 M3 heat inserts into the designated slots for the 4010 fan on the mount. Ensure they are properly seated.

# Prepare the Hotend:

Remove the V6 mount from the Rapido hotend.

# Mount the Rapido:

Directly mount the Rapido hotend to the bottom of the bracket using the screws that come with the hotend.
Insert the small piece of Bowden tube before placing the mount onto the front of the LGX Light.

# Mount the rest

Position the mount correctly and snap it into place. It is a tight fit, so ensure it is properly aligned.
There are 2 M3 bolts that can be used to bolt the bracket to the side of the LGX Light to keep it in place.

Once in place, using the 2 M3 x 40mm or 45mm screws, bolt the assembly to the front of the Seckit Breezer duct using the standard mounting holes.
