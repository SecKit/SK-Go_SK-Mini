## Assembly Instructions

Print the provided Lead Screw Aligner file using your 3D printer. Ensure that the dimensions are accurate and the print quality is high.

Insert the 608RS bearing into the designated slot in the Lead Screw Aligner. Ensure it fits snugly and is seated properly.

Slide the part over the top of the lead screw and snap into place over the extrusion. You can use t-nuts to secure in place but it is snug and will stay there without it.
Position the Lead Screw Aligner near the top of the lead screw and keep enough clearance between the bed bracket and the tool on your 3D printer. The bearing should keep the lead screw centered and free to rotate at all times.
