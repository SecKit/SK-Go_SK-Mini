SK-Go/SK-Mini can still start it's initial print without theses parts. Below are some workarounds if you don't have them printed.

**Assembly guide**

A ruler or caliper that keeps dimensions consistent will work. It's just a convenient tool and you can still complete the building without it.

**Cable pillar**

Temporarily hold wires/cables onto sticks.

**Driver cooling fan mount**

TMC drivers still work without a fan and they auto reduce working current if overheated.

**Part-cooling fan duct**

A desktop fan placed by the printer will work.

**X-min sensorless homing bumper**

It still homes without this bumper, just noisier.

**12864 Display cover**

The display still works without a cover.

**Filament sensor holder**

Temporarily turn sensor off in the display menu, or put a piece of filament in the sensor to emulate filament always exists.
